                insurance office. After moving to London and then Hampton, she eventually married her next door
                neighbour from Reading, John Cook. He was an officer in the Merchant Navy and after he left the sea in

                Beryl bought their young son a box of watercolours, and when showing him how to use it, she decided that
                she herself quite enjoyed painting. John subsequently bought her a child’s painting set for her birthday
                and it was with this that she produced her first significant work, a half-length portrait of a
